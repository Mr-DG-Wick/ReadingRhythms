## About
ReadingRhythms helps readers find the best music playlist that they can listen to while reading their favorite novel, manga or manhwa in order to maximize their reading experience.

The app finds the perfect music playlist that complements the book by harnessing the power of generative AI and the internet. First, the app gathers information about the book from online sources, analyzes its genre and themes, and then leverages this knowledge to identify connections between the book and music playlists available on platforms like YouTube and Spotify. Finally, it selects the top three playlists that best match the book's ambiance and atmosphere for the listeners to enjoy.

This innovative app was developed using AWS PartyRock, a cutting-edge platform for creating AI-powered applications.
